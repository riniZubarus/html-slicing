          <p>By giving support to the Women's Front, you contribute to the work for women's liberation locally, nationally and internationally. <br><br>
            The Women's Front is a member organization independent of party politics. We run extensive and versatile women's political work; both locally, nationally and internationally. Women's liberation is not possible without economic independence and a well-developed welfare society. <br><br>
            Our goal is a society where everyone can live out their identity, love, sexuality and their way of being a woman based on equality and consent, without the risk of being discriminated against and/or harassed. <br><br>
            We carry out broad women's political work, and work on topics such as self-determined abortion, prostitution, financial independence, porn, the six-hour working day, international solidarity, and much more.<br><br>
            To continue our important work, we are completely dependent on the support of members and friends. By donating a monthly amount to Kvinnefronten, you help make our economy more stable and predictable - thank you!</p>
